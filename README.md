# Templates

This projects represents a collection of resources I've written as solutions to common tasks.

## Modules

* API
* Favicon
* JavaScript starter setup with Node, Grunt, RequireJS, and Backbone.

## @todo

* Provide commands to quickly download a module.
* Wait!  Just use Yeoman.
  * ~~Better yet, provide a way to clone the repo and build the project with just the modules you want.~~
  * ~~While I'm at it, set up a fully-stocked Gruntfile and package.json and bower.json and some CI server file, too.~~
* And if I could add some scripts and resource links that are just generally useful, that'd be cake.
